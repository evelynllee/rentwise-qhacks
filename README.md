# RentWise 

This project was developed during QHacks (Queen's hackathon) to address the issue of irregularities and deviations from standardized agreements. RentWise helps identify, track, and report discrepancies in contracts or other formal agreements, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to monitor compliance.

## Learning Experience 

As this was my first time working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I focused on building a dynamic, responsive, and minimalistic front-end while collaborating with my team on the back-end logic and deployment.
